# Basics of Machine Learning - No Magic, Just Math!

## Notes to add
* Always much trial, test and error to find best settings (especially linear regression)
* Backreference from sigmoid 0/1 to on/off of axon, there are other functions that can be used

## Other things (if there is time)
* Get example to work using Spark 2

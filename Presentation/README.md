# Basics of Machine Learning - No Magic, Just Math!

## Slide ToDos
1. Better example for linear regression
2. Always refer back to topics from the beginning, maybe on extra slide with small images
3. More library research
4. How to find the right algorithm for a specific problem (mostly backreference and diagram)

## Notes to add
* Always much trial, test and error to find best settings (especially linear regression)
* Backreference from sigmoid 0/1 to on/off of axon

## Other things (if there is time)
* Get example to work using Spark 2

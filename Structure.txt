Structure

- Hi, I'm Roman and I'm Happy to see you all here even if its late into the day and we heard a lot of great talks so far
- Hoping to show you some cool things about machine learning, as its all around us these days, especially as a buzzword - but its no magic, just math
- I have brought you an introduction to machine learning and I will get you started on this topic.
    but if you are already experienced don't worry. i'm sure that you will get something out of this as well
- One quick note: You will find me as "Roman Tilgner" in todays program, but two weeks ago,
    I took my wife's name and you'll find me on twitter as urlaubsgimpel or under my new name: roman Seyffarth - so don't get confused
- I think now were all set so let's begin! - as i said, machine learning is all around us...
